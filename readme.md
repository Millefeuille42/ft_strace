# ft_strace
ft_strace project at 42 School

## Main part
Create a program that does the same thing as strace (minus the flags)

## Log
This project is quite hard, there is a lot of stuff going on and some of
✨ **M A G I C** ✨ going on with ptrace... Lot of documentation to read.

I'd recommend to:
- Check documentation about signals
- Check documentation about syscalls and registers
- Read thoroughly the documentation of ptrace, there is a lot going on and it's easy to miss stuff.
